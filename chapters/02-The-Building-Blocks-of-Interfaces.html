            <h1>The Building Blocks of Interfaces</h1>

            <p>In this chapter <strong>I’ll introduce the fundamental building blocks that interfaces are made
                    from</strong>:
                Objects, Components, Patterns, Pages and Flows. <strong>I’ll break apart a series of interface
                    elements</strong> –
                which I’ll also provide as swipe files for reference – <strong>and I’ll analyse how everything we
                    use in an
                    interface is constructed from simple building blocks, or objects</strong>.</p>
            <p>I’ve created a series of supporting files – reference files and Adobe XD artboards – to accompany
                this chapter (and
                many of the other chapters). <strong>These supporting files walk through the process for more visual
                    learners and
                    can be used alongside the book.</strong></p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Over the following three connected chapters <strong>I’ll progressively introduce the fundamentals of user
                    interface
                    design</strong> step by step. These three chapters are essentially the heart of the book – I’d
                strongly
                encourage you to read all of them – <strong>they will introduce you to the principles you need to master
                    to become a
                    fully-fledged user interface designer</strong>.</p>
            <p>In this chapter, ‘The Building Blocks of Interfaces’, I’ll introduce the idea of <strong>a core set of
                    components
                    with which we can build interfaces</strong>. These include: buttons, toggles, tags and other
                essential
                components. I’ll show how these components are constructed and explain <strong>how they form the basis
                    of a
                    consistent, yet flexible, design system</strong>.</p>
            <p>In Chapter 3, ‘Information Architecture’, <strong>I’ll explore how we can combine these components to
                    create
                    patterns, out of which we build pages</strong>. These patterns include familiar design patterns,
                including
                ‘cards’, <strong>popularised by Google’s <a href="https://material.io/design/components/cards.html"
                        target='__blank'>Material
                        Design</a> principles</strong>. Lastly – as the chapter’s title promises – <strong>I’ll explore
                    the
                    principles of information architecture</strong>.</p>
            <p>In Chapter 4, ‘Getting From A → B’, <strong>I’ll tie everything together by introducing the idea of
                    ‘journey mapping’
                    and ‘user flows’</strong>. By focusing on how pages are connected together I’ll explore the last
                piece of the
                user interface jigsaw: <strong>considering how users move through an interface</strong>, getting from A
                → B.</p>
            <p>With the overview of Chapters 2-4 mapped out, let’s get down to business and explore the fundamental
                building blocks
                of user interfaces, exploring how components are created.</p>

                <img src="/images/ch2/lego.jpg" alt="LEGO">
                <figcaption>With a mountain of LEGO bricks, we can build virtually anything. We’re limited only by our
                    imagination. User interfaces are the same: Once we’ve created some basic components – buttons,
                    toggles and tags, for example – we can build any UI we desire. [Photograph by <a

            <p>When you’re starting on your journey as a user interface designer <strong>it can be intimidating trying
                    to work out
                    how different interfaces are built</strong>.</p>
            <p>Take any interface, however, and you’ll see that <strong>even the most complicated of interfaces is built
                    up of
                    simpler components and patterns</strong>. By zooming in and starting with these components and
                patterns you can
                quickly develop an understanding of how UIs are constructed.</p>
            <p>Working with my students at Belfast School of Art, I encourage them to <strong>take existing interfaces
                    and break
                    them down into their constituent parts</strong>. By using a <a
                    href="/resources/masterapprentice.html">‘Master-Apprentice’</a>
                approach – analysing others’ interfaces and rebuilding them – <strong>you not only learn about how
                    interfaces are
                    constructed, but you also begin to understand the principles that lie behind good interface
                    design</strong>.</p>
            <h3>The Master-Apprentice Model</h3>
            <p>The Master-Apprentice model stretches back to the days of painters like <a
                    href="https://oldmasters.academy/old-masters-academy-art-lessons/who-were-rembrandts-teachers-and-students"
                    target='__blank'>Rembrandt</a>
                and I believe it’s worth revisiting. <strong>By focusing on rebuilding others’ interfaces to start with,
                    you learn
                    to ‘train your eye’.</strong> This approach also helps you to develop the techniques you need to
                master before
                putting them into practice in your own creative work.</p>
            <p>In the 17th century, apprentices’s education was undertaken for a minimum of 2-3 years, and – at times –
                for as many
                as seven years. A two year apprenticeship was considered to be the minimum, with guild rules dictating
                that an
                apprentice couldn’t leave their master before their term had ended. An apprenticeship was an investment,
                with a
                total cost of 600-700 guilders, which could buy a small house at that time.</p>
            <p>The good news is that – in our connected world underpinned by the web – <strong>you can embark upon a
                    ‘virtual
                    apprenticeship’ at relatively little cost</strong>. All you need is time and a willingness to work
                hard and
                learn. <a href="https://dribbble.com/search?q=UI" target='__blank'>Dribbble</a> is a good place to
                start. <strong>Search for <a href="https://dribbble.com/search?q=UI" target='__blank'>UI</a>, choose
                    something you like and rebuild it.</strong></p>
            <p>One small, but important point to note: What I’m <strong>not</strong> suggesting is <strong>copying your
                    finished
                    user interface</strong> by raiding Dribbble like a Viking. <strong>I’m suggesting learning to use
                    drawing tools
                    – like XD – by deconstructing and rebuilding others’ work.</strong></p>

            </figure>
            <p>To help you on your learning journey <strong>I’ve provided a series of <a
                        href="/resources/masterapprentice.html">‘Master-Apprentice’</a>
                    examples</strong> in addition to the example above, so you can see how these exercises work.</p>
            <p>I’ve provided examples of desktop, mobile (smartphone, tablet) and wrist UIs so <strong>you can begin to
                    develop an
                    understanding of different interfaces across a range of contexts</strong>. I created these myself so
                that I
                could develop my skills. I might be fast approaching 50 years old, but I’m still learning!</p>
            <p>It’s worth stressing that I’m not the only seasoned designer who adopts this approach. Chris Coyier – the
                co-founder
                of <a href="https://codepen.io" target='__blank'>CodePen</a> and the wunderkind behind the wonderful <a
                    href="https://css-tricks.com" target='__blank'>CSS Tricks</a> – also embraces the Master-Apprentice
                approach (although I suspect
                he doesn’t consciously call it this).</p>

                Code’s <a href="https://culturedcode.com/status/" target='__blank'>Things Status Board</a> is a lovely
                example and ably demonstrates that
                <strong>even designers with years of experience are still focused on developing their own

            <h3>LEGO FTW!</h3>
            <p>One of the reasons that LEGO is such a much-loved product is the fact that <strong>from a series of
                    individual
                    building blocks you can make almost anything you put your mind to</strong>. You’re limited only by
                your
                imagination.</p>
            <p>Just like LEGO blocks can be combined to create relatively complicated constructions, so, too,
                <strong>complex
                    interfaces can be created from relatively simple components</strong>.</p>
            <p>Break apart any page – whether it’s desktop-, mobile- or wrist-based – and you’ll see that it’s created
                from a series
                of components and patterns. <strong>Mastering how to draw these different components and patterns will
                    put you in a
                    position to create anything your UI requires.</strong></p>

            <p>The temptation when you’re starting out is to dive in at the deep end and try to build something
                all-encompassing and
                complicated. This isn’t an approach I’d recommend. <strong>Taking on too big a challenge can quickly
                    lead to
                    frustration because you’ve undertaken a task that’s far too challenging and complex.</strong></p>
            <p>A far better approach – one that LEGO also uses – is to <strong>start with something simple and
                    progressively add
                    complexity as your skills develop</strong>. Practice makes perfect and as Mr Miyagi – from the film
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fULNUr0rvEc" target='__blank'>The Karate Kid</a> – emphasises:
                “Wax on. Wax off.” If you
                haven’t seen The Karate Kid: firstly, you should (the original, not the remake); secondly, Mr Miyagi’s
                sage advice
                is simple, but proven to be effective: practice, practice, practice.</p>
            <p>In short: <strong>Master the fundamentals and the rest falls into place,</strong> or learn to walk before
                you attempt
                to run.</p>
            <p>With that out of the way, let’s take a look at the different constituent parts that comprise an interface
                and begin
                to unravel them.</p>

                    alt="Objects → Components → Patterns → Pages → Flows">
                <figcaption>Everything we build is created from relatively simple objects. By combining these objects in
                    different ways we can create different user interface components, which can then be combined to
                    create patterns that are then organised on pages. Link these pages together and we have the flows
                    that underpin our user interface.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p><strong>Everything we create is built from smaller parts.</strong> At the simplest level, user interfaces
                are comprised of the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objects:</strong> An object is a basic building block from which we build interfaces: points
                    (circles), lines and planes; icons; and typographic elements. (Icons are built from objects, too.)
                </li>
                <li><strong>Components:</strong> A component is <em>created from objects</em> and is something like <a
                        href="/images/ch2/buttons.png" target='__blank'>a button</a>, <a href="/images/ch2/toggles.png"
                        target='__blank'>a toggle</a>, or <a href="/images/ch2/progress-indicators.png"
                        target='__blank'>a progress indicator</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Patterns:</strong> A pattern is <em>created from components</em> and is something like a <a
                        href="https://design-system.futurelearn.com/molecules/card" target='__blank'>card</a>, a <a
                        href="https://design-system.futurelearn.com/molecules/date-input" target='__blank'>date
                        picker</a>, or a <a href="https://design-system.futurelearn.com/molecules/feed-item"
                        target='__blank'>feed item</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Pages:</strong> A page is <em>created from objects, components and patterns</em>.</li>
                <li><strong>Flows:</strong> A flow is <em>created from a series of pages that are linked together</em>.
                    A flow is
                    what we’re building towards – <strong>from the ground up</strong> – and is the most complex part of
                    the
                    equation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In this chapter, <strong>I’ll be focusing on components, demonstrating how they can be built from simple
                    objects:
                    points (circles), lines and planes; icons; and typographic elements</strong>.</p>
            <p>In the next chapter, I’ll show how these <strong>components can be combined to create patterns and
                    pages</strong>,
                which form the backbone of our user interfaces. In the following chapter, I’ll explore how <strong>we
                    can tie these
                    separate pages together into flows that allow a user to navigate through an interface</strong>.</p>
            <p>This approach – Objects → Components → Patterns → Pages → Flows – is similar to Brad Frost’s <a
                    href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/" target='__blank'>Atomic Design</a> methodology.
                I never dived deep into
                science, so <strong>I find Frost’s naming convention – which features a metaphor of ‘atoms’ and
                    ‘molecules’ from the
                    world of chemistry, and ‘organisms’ from the world of biology – a little confusing</strong>.</p>
            <p>Frost’s methodology is also <strong>directed primarily at front-end designers who are using HTML, CSS and
                    JavaScript</strong>. Designing interfaces in a tool like Adobe XD is increasingly separated from the
                world of
                code. (Although, to be clear – in case I spark the ‘designers should know how to code’ debate –
                <strong>it’s
                    critical at the very least to have an understanding of code!</strong>)</p>
            <p>That Frost’s Atomic Design methodology has shaped our thinking, is beyond doubt. <strong>His approach
                    encouraged us
                    to think about what we build in a much more systematic way:</strong> laying the foundations by
                focusing on
                re-usable, ‘atomic’ elements that are then orchestrated into progressively more complex elements that
                are then –
                collectively – used as the basis for pages.</p>
            <p>That said, <strong>I’ve adopted a less complicated naming system, which I believe is easier to
                    understand</strong>,
                after having tried and tested it on my students and studiomates.</p>
            <p>Given the rise of different specialisms that we’re seeing emerging in the world of user experience
                design, I believe
                <strong>there’s a need for a different naming convention, one that’s specifically focused on visual
                    designers
                    creating user interfaces</strong>.</p>
            <p>Looking at the illustration at the beginning of this section, I prefer the labels: <strong>objects,
                    components,
                    patterns, pages and flows</strong>. I find these labels easier to grasp and they should, I feel,
                need no
                explanation.</p>
            <p>I’ve drawn these terms by looking at the work of others, particularly the award-winning GOV.UK team’s
                work on the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk" target='__blank'>GOV.UK Design System</a>. As
                GOV.UK put it:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Learn from the research and experience of other service teams and avoid repeating work that’s already
                    been done.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>There’s no need to reinvent the wheel and, in the spirit of reusing existing naming conventions, I’ve
                drawn my naming
                methodology from their work, adding the term ‘objects’ to explain the fundamental building blocks from
                which all of
                our user interfaces are created.</p>
            <h3>Objects → Components</h3>
            <p><strong>Every component that we create for a user interface is built from smaller objects.</strong> By
                learning to
                mentally break apart the components we encounter – into their constituent objects – we begin to
                understand how they
                are constructed.</p>
            <p>Analysing how existing components are built we see that <strong>everything we see in a user interface – a
                    component,
                    a pattern or a page – is comprised of other, simpler objects</strong>.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="/images/ch2/constructing-elements.png" alt="Placeholder">
                <figcaption>In the above example, the button component is comprised of smaller, simpler objects: a
                    plane of
                    colour; some typography; a circle and two lines that form an arrow.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This idea – <strong>of building complexity from the object up</strong> – lies at the heart of everything
                we do.
                Grasping it we understand that <strong>components – the fundamental units from which we build interfaces
                    – are
                    created from relatively simple objects</strong>.</p>
            <p>Understanding how the fundamental building blocks of interfaces work – at a simple, component level –
                helps us to
                develop a language of components that we can then combine and build into complex interfaces through the
                creation of
                patterns and pages.</p>
            <p>One significant benefit of the approach of <strong>building from the component up</strong> is that
                <strong>we’re
                    effectively constructing a design system to ensure our interfaces are consistent</strong> (and
                easier to build).
                I’ll explore design systems in the closing section of this chapter, for now, let’s acquaint ourselves
                with the
                anatomy of some further components.</p>
            <h3>Anatomy of a Component</h3>

            <p>In this section, I’ll unravel a few more components to further underline how we can re-use objects to
                create
                consistent user interfaces. <strong>I’ll also stress the importance of paying attention to the details,
                    which are a
                    critical component of successful UIs.</strong> As Charles and Ray Eames famously noted:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The details are not the details; they make the product.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>By reusing a series of core objects to build your components, <strong>your user interface benefits from a
                    consistent
                    and systematic approach</strong>. By working with a core set of objects you ensure that the details
                take care of
                themselves. As you start to build your components, <strong>it’s important to put some thought into their
                    consistency</strong>.</p>
            <p>User interfaces that are inconsistent are not only aesthetically poor, but they also <strong>lead to
                    confused and
                    frustrated users</strong>, which can result in even the most promising of digital products to fail.
            </p>
            <p>Consistency isn’t just about <strong>how user interfaces look</strong>, it’s also about <strong>how user
                    interfaces
                    behave</strong>. I’ll explore behaviour in depth in <a
                    href="/chapters/07-Animating-Interfaces.html">Chapter 7:
                    Animating Interfaces</a>, so I’ll be focusing in this chapter on the look of your components, but
                keep in mind
                behaviour – and feel – is important, too.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="/images/ch2/a-range-of-different-elements.png" alt="Placeholder">
                <figcaption>This is a temporary image. It will be replaced by an image of four components that shows
                    how they
                    are consistently built. I’ll be highlighting: stroke widths; consistent border radius, colours,
                    etc.. (Show: a
                    button, a toggle, a tag and a tool tip.)</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>As you build your components, consider how they are consistently:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>aligned;</li>
                <li>sized; and</li>
                <li>scaled.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It’s also import to <strong>consider the relationships between your components</strong> and how they
                correlate to
                each other. It’s highly unlikely that your components will exist in isolation. I’ll explore clustering,
                proximity
                and relationships in the next chapter, but <strong>as you build different components, bear in mind that
                    they’ll be
                    existing as part of a wider system</strong>.</p>
            <p>It’s important to focus on consistency, ensuring that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>line weights are the same thickness throughout (unless there’s a reason for them not to be);</li>
                <li>your colour palette is consistent;</li>
                <li>any elements with a border-radius uses the same radius; and</li>
                <li>padding within elements is the same.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>This level of attention to detail is what sets apart the masters from the amateurs.</strong> It
                might seem
                overwrought, but the benefits of this approach can’t be stressed highly enough. We’re striving for as
                close to
                perfection as we can achieve!</p>

                <figcaption>In the above example, we see a range of different components: buttons (in various states);
                    stars,
                    perhaps for a rating system; social icons; scroll buttons; and search boxes. Each of these
                    components is – as
                    we’ve seen – quite simply constructed, according to a consistent system.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now that we understand how components are constructed, it’s time to dive in and explore some of the
                components you
                might need for your user interface designs. Where possible, if a component exists as a design pattern,
                it’s best to
                use this.</p>
            <p>As I noted in the preceding chapter, users have a mental model of how interfaces work, so <strong>try –
                    as much as
                    possible – to work within existing conventions</strong>. By doing so, your users will at least have
                a head start
                when using your interface.</p>
            <p>The following isn’t an exhaustive list, but it does provide an overview of some typical components you’ll
                need to
                consider.</p>
            <p>There are many, many more components in user interface design. Ever-helpful, usability.gov have put
                together lots of
                useful information at <a
                    href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/user-interface-elements.html"
                    target='__blank'>User
                    Interface Elements</a>. As they put it:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>When designing your interface, try to be consistent and predictable in your choice of interface
                    elements.</p>
                <p>Whether they are aware of it or not, users have become familiar with elements acting in a certain
                    way, so
                    choosing to adopt those elements when appropriate will help with task completion, efficiency and
                    satisfaction.
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The interfaces you design won’t necessarily need <strong>all</strong> of the components that
                usability.gov list, but
                it will include a substantial number. As ever, if a pattern for something exists, use it. Sticking to
                these mental
                models as closely as you can will <strong>result in a user interface that’s clearer and more easily
                    understood</strong>.</p>

                <figcaption>This is a temporary image. It will be replaced by an image of four buttons. In the above
                    example, we
                    see four types of button: 1. A text button (for low emphasis); 2. An outlined button (with slightly
                    more
                    emphasis); 3. A solid button (with high emphasis); and 4. A button with an active state (perhaps
                    being
                    pressed).</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h4>Buttons</h4>
            <p>Buttons indicate an action – on click or touch – that users can take, and are typically labelled with
                text, an icon
                or both. You’ll use them throughout your interface in places like: dialogs, forms and toolbars.</p>
            <p>Google’s Material Design guidelines have <a href="https://material.io/design/components/buttons.html"
                    target='__blank'>a useful
                    overview of buttons</a> with an interactive tool that lets you preview button components and their
                different
                variations.</p>
            <p>When designing a button, try and ensure it’s clearly communicated within your interface and looks
                ‘clickable’. This
                is particularly important if your button is for a <a
                    href="https://www.optimizely.com/uk/optimization-glossary/call-to-action/" target='__blank'>‘call to
                    action’</a>. As the above
                illustration shows, you can adjust the emphasis of a button by varying its design.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/ch2/toggles.png" alt="Placeholder">
                <figcaption>This is a temporary image. It will be replaced by an image of a series of different types of
                    toggles. Toggles (or switches) allow users to change settings between two states: on / off, for
                    example.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Toggles (Or Switches)</h4>
            <p>Toggles or switches <strong>enable users to complete tasks that require binary choices to be
                    made</strong>, for
                example, turning various settings on or off.</p>
            <p>In addition to toggles or switches, radio buttons or checkboxes can be used, depending on the content
                you’re
                designing. <strong>Toggles or switches should be used instead of radio buttons or checkboxes when the
                    choice is
                    binary: A or B.</strong></p>
            <p>Toggles allow users to change settings between two states, for example: activating or deactivating
                something.
                <strong>Ensuring the on and off states are visually distinct improves toggles usability.</strong></p>
            <p>Once again, Google’s Material Design guidelines have <a
                    href="https://material.io/design/components/selection-controls.html" target='__blank'>a useful
                    overview of selection controls</a>
                that’s well worth reading.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/ch2/progress-indicators.png" alt="Placeholder">
                <figcaption>This is a temporary image. It will be replaced by a better spaced image with more examples.
                    At the
                    simplest level, we might use two different colored lines as a progress indicator. We can also add
                    complexity to
                    develop richer progress indicators, for example, including animation.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Progress Indicators</h4>
            <p>Progress indicators <strong>communicate what stage a user is as at as they progress through a series of
                    tasks</strong>. They can also be used to <strong>indicate other types of information, for example,
                    the progress
                    of a download</strong>.</p>
            <p>Progress indicators can be:<strong> dynamic</strong>, for example, providing user feedback about the
                progress of a
                download; or <strong>static</strong>, for example, showing where a user is in a sequence of tasks.</p>
            <p>Progress indicators are useful for communicating time and alleviating your users’ concerns by showing
                them that
                <strong>something is happening</strong>. There is also an opportunity – should your design warrant it –
                to design
                progress bars designed to <strong><a
                        href="https://www.justinmind.com/blog/10-inspiring-progress-bars-that-delight-users/"
                        target='__blank'>delight
                        users</a></strong> while they wait.</p>
            <p>Progress indicators come in both linear and circular forms, as in the above example. Linear progress
                indicators are
                composed of two required elements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Track:</strong> The track is a fixed width rule, with set boundaries (establishing the
                        beginning (0%)
                        and end (100%)) for the indicator to travel along.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Indicator:</strong> The indicator animates along the length of the track.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>As I noted above, it’s important to handle your interface elements consistently.</strong> If
                you’ve used a
                circular progress indicator for a refresh action on one screen, that same action shouldn’t use a linear
                indicator on
                another screen.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/ch2/tags.png" alt="Placeholder">
                <figcaption>This is a temporary image. It will be replaced by a better spaced image showing a series of
                    tags
                    designed in different way. Tags can be used to communicate different groupings and can also be
                    dynamic,
                    interacted with like buttons, here indicating which tags are selected.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Tags</h4>
            <p>Tags are useful in lots of different contexts, for example, <strong>in profile patterns or in
                    content-driven
                    pages</strong>. They can be used to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>filter content;</li>
                <li>make suggestions; or</li>
                <li>trigger actions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When designing tags, it’s important to <strong>ensure that they are visually and behaviourally
                    consistent</strong>.
                Tags are often integrated into components, for example, a set of tags indicating interests on a user
                profile card,
                as in the example above.
            </p>

                <figcaption>This is a temporary image. It will be replaced by a better spaced image. At the simplest
                    level, we
                    might use two rectangles to create a tool tip, as shown above.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Tool Tips</h4>

            <p>As the digital products we design and build become ever more complex, it’s important to provide users
                with a helping
                hand where possible.</p>
            <p>Tool tips are perfect for providing users with additional informative text when users hover over, focus
                on or tap
                elements. <strong>When designing tool tips, it’s important to consider their behaviour</strong> and how
                they appear
                (considering, for example, transitions and timings).</p>
            <p>Tool tips often appear <strong>on top of the screen the user is currently interacting with</strong>,
                saving a round
                trip back and forth to a help page. When designing tool tips <strong>ensure that they don’t hide or
                    obstruct the
                    components they are referring to</strong>.</p>
            <p>Tool tips often fade in, remain present while the user is interacting with them and then automatically
                fade out when
                their purpose has been served. As I noted above, I’ll explore these behavioural attributes in more depth
                in <a href="/chapters/07-Animating-Interfaces.html">Chapter 7:

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/ch2/gloo-icons.png" alt="Vic Bell Gloo Icons">
                <figcaption>Vic Bell’s Gloo icons were designed to help app designer Roberto Ortiz inject a little more
                    life and
                    character into his user interface designs. These are just a handful drawn from <a
                        href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/59585629/Gloo" target='__blank'>a very detailed and
                        precise icon set created for the
                        project</a>.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Icons aren’t really the same as components, rather <strong>you might use them within components or in
                    addition to
                    components</strong> to create a user interface that communicates clearly. <strong>Icons are an
                    incredibly
                    powerful part of the UI designer’s toolkit</strong> and are an important part of user interface
                design.</p>
            <p>Icons, or pictograms, <strong>convey information through the use of representational symbols</strong> and
                are useful
                where <strong>cross-cultural communication</strong> is important.</p>
            <p><strong>You’ve doubtless encountered icons, certainly you will have in an airport when you’re perhaps
                    lost</strong> –
                in a strange land, where you perhaps don’t speak the local language – and are looking for something.
                <strong>Icons
                    help you</strong> to: find a toilet (should you need to spend a penny); find a taxi rank (if you’re
                in a hurry);
                or find the departures gates (when you’re invariably running late).</p>
            <p>The use of icons in this context, and their ability to supercede language, are <strong>a testament to
                    their power as
                    non-verbal forms of communication</strong>. It’s this ability to transcend language – working across
                different
                languages, or accompanying different languages – that makes them so useful in interface design.</p>
            <p>We live in an increasingly global world and <strong>the websites and applications we build often have a
                    global
                    audience</strong>. As such, adding icons to your UI toolbox is a great way to ensure your interfaces
                speak to
                the widest possible audience.</p>
            <p>Drawing icons is a specialist skill (although like any skill, it can be learned). There are many talented
                icon
                designers and I’ll be interviewing a particularly gifted one – Vic Bell – in <a
                    href="/chapters/08-Project-X-Rays.html">Chapter 8:
                    Project X-Rays</a>.</p>
            <p>If your budget won’t stretch to cover a specialist icon designer, <a href="https://thenounproject.com"
                    target='__blank'>The Noun
                    Project</a> is an excellent resource that is bound to have an icon to suit every eventuality.</p>
            <p>Founded in 2010, The Noun Project, “celebrates the world’s visual language,” and offers over two million
                curated
                icons created by a global community.</p>
            <p>That said – as the illustrations in this chapter clearly demonstrate – <strong>commissioning a bespoke
                    icon set by a
                    specialist designer can add a great deal of personality and life to your user interface
                    design</strong> and is
                worth considering.</p>
            <h3>From Cave Paintings to the Present Day</h3>
            <p>Icons have been used since the dawn of man as <strong>a way of communicating without language</strong>.
                The term icon
                derives from the Greek εἰκόνα (‘eikona’), meaning ‘image’, which is itself derived from from ‘eikénai’,
                which
                translates as ‘to be similar’ or ‘to appear’.</p>
            <p>The use of pictograms, or icons, was pioneered at the 1964, 1968 and 1972 Olympic Games in the form of
                <strong>pictographic ‘wayfinding systems’ to help visitors ‘find their way’</strong>.</p>
            <p>Just as these iconic systems helped people to find their way in a strange environment, so too, <strong>we
                    can use
                    icons to help users find their way around an interface</strong>.</p>
            <p>One of the best known sets of icons are Otl Aicher’s icons for the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. The
                wonderful <a href="https://www.piktogramm.de/en/" target='__blank'>otl aicher pictograms</a> – a website
                celebrating Aicher’s
                groundbreaking
                work – delves into their history and the site features an excellent overview of <a
                    href="https://www.piktogramm.de/en/#c53" target='__blank'>pictograms past and present</a> that is
                well worth
                reading. As the
                website notes:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Pictograms were the precursors of writing historically speaking. Back in prehistory, Stone Age
                    dwellers used
                    pictorial symbols to record their experiences for posterity on cave walls.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This ‘pictorial language’ can still be read today: We might not be able to understand a Stone Age
                hunter-gatherer
                (if, that is, we were able to encounter one), but we can certainly look at a cave painting and unravel
                the story
                behind it.</p>
            <p>It is this universality that makes icons so powerful. Using them we can design user interfaces that act
                as a
                ‘universal language’ for wayfinding within interfaces.</p>
            <h3>A ‘Universal Language’ for Wayfinding</h3>
            <p>As I explored in Chapter 1, with the rise of personal computers and their subsequent move away from
                command-line
                interfaces towards graphical interfaces, <strong>the use of icons emerged as a form of universal
                    language to allow
                    users to find their way around what were then unfamiliar operating systems</strong>.</p>
            <p>One of the best known examples of this were Susan Kare’s original icons for the <a
                    href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-woman-who-gave-the-macintosh-a-smile"
                    target='__blank'>Macintosh</a>.
                Kare’s icons – designed using only black and white (due to the constraints of early screens) – have a
                timeless
                quality to them and it’s no surprise to see them housed <a href="https://www.moma.org/artists/38483"
                    target='__blank'>in the
                    collection of New York’s Museum of Modern Art</a>.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/ch2/original-macintosh-icons.png" alt="Susan Kare’s Original Macintosh Icons">
                <figcaption>Susan Kare’s original icons for the Macintosh were instrumental in the rise of GUIs and
                    icon-driven
                    interfaces.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>By embracing metaphors – built around everyday objects – Kare was able to provide a helping hand to users
                new to GUIs
                enabling them to understand how the interface worked: <strong>a piece of paper</strong> represented a
                document,
                which you could store in <strong>a folder</strong> and, when you no longer needed it, you could move it
                to <strong>a
                    trashcan</strong>.</p>
            <p>Look at any interface and you’ll see icons in action. Returning to Vic Bell’s work, <a
                    href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/53544233/Uber-Iconography" target='__blank'>her iconography
                    for Uber</a> is a lovely suite
                of icons – designed at different resolutions – to allow the company to ensure its communication is
                consistent. </p>
            <p>On a smaller screen, where space is a premium, Bell has designed a distilled set of simpler icons.
                However, on a
                larger screen, where there’s more space she’s <a
                    href="https://dribbble.com/shots/3124553-Uber-Iconography" target='__blank'>embraced
                    colour and added detail</a>. In this way, iconography can act as both a form of communication and a
                means of
                underlining a brand. A win win.</p>

                    consistent visual language</strong>. Do this at the component level and you will – by extension as
                you build
                patterns from components – have the basis of a design system.</p>
            <p>Design systems have <strong>changed the way we design and build both websites and applications</strong>.
                They’re
                quickly becoming a cornerstone of large (and even small) organisation’s digital product design
                strategies.</p>
            <p>Design systems are useful to learn about if you’re getting started in user interface design, because they
                encourage
                you to adopt a systematic approach towards the UIs you design.</p>
            <p><strong>By adopting a systematic approach towards your UI as you build it, you can ensure that subsequent
                    elements
                    and components you add to your design follow a consistent trajectory.</strong> The result is a
                unified look and
                feel as your website or application scales.</p>
            <p>A detailed exploration of design systems is beyond the scope of this book, but I would wholeheartedly
                recommend
                reading up on them. I’d strongly recommend Alla Kholmatova’s <a
                    href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/design-systems-by-alla-kholmatova?utm_source=shop&amp;utm_medium=sidebar-widget"
                    target='__blank'>Design
                    Systems: A Practical Guide to Creating Design Languages for Digital Products</a> as a starting
                point. I have a
                copy and it’s <strong>filled</strong> with Post-It Notes!</p>

                <figcaption>FutureLearn’s design system ensures that everything the FutureLearn team, and its partners,
                    design
                    and build is considered, cohesive and consistent.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Kholmatova shephered the development of FutureLearn’s <a href="https://design-system.futurelearn.com"
                    target='__blank'>Design
                    System</a>, which is also worth looking at. Her knowledge of design systems is unparalleled and her
                book is
                excellent and well worth owning.</p>

            <p>The good news is that, <strong>if you’re building from the component up – as this book encourages –
                    you’ll have a
                    head start on building a design system</strong>, because the methodology I recommend – Objects →
                Components →
                Patterns → Pages → Flows – is designed to be built in a scalable manner, from the component up.</p>
            <h3>What is a design system?</h3>
            <p>Put simply, a design system is a collection of components and patterns that can be combined and reused to
                build
                digital products.</p>

            <p>Returning to the LEGO metaphor I used in <a
                    href="/chapters/02-The-Building-Blocks-of-Interfaces.html">Section
                    1</a>, a design system is like having a series of LEGO bricks that are brand new (shiny and right
                out of the
                box).</p>
            <p>When you buy a LEGO kit, the bricks it ships with are designed to fit together visually and
                aesthetically. (Unlike
                the giant boxes of LEGO bricks that you accumulate over time!)</p>
            <p>A design system takes a similar approach. Instead of building components and patterns in an ad hoc manner
                as you need
                them, <strong>you take a systematic approach so that everything fits together aesthetically</strong>. As
                you add new
                components and patterns to your system, you draw on your design system to ensure consistency.</p>
            <p>Embracing design systems pays off with a number of incredibly valuable benefits. A design system ensures:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>your user interface is consistent;</li>
                <li>your components and patterns are faster to design and build; and</li>
                <li>your collaboration with others is considerably smoother.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Embracing a design system also results in more consistent branding for the different projects that you
                work on,
                leading to happier clients.</p>
            <p>I touched on styleguides in <a href="/chapters/01-Designing-Interfaces.html">Chapter
                    1: Designing Interfaces</a> when I introduced styleguides.io, which gathers pattern libraries and
                style guides,
                but it’s worth exploring design systems, specifically, here.</p>

                <figcaption>Jad Limcaco’s <a href="https://designsystemsrepo.com/design-systems/"
                        target='__blank'>Design Systems Repo</a> is an

                    target='__blank'>Design Systems Repo</a> is
                an excellent place to start. Created by Jad Limcaco, a designer at Apple, it started life as a
                collection of
                resources – examples, articles and tools – for Limcaco’s personal reference.</p>
            <p>Generously, Limcaco spent time (no doubt a considerable amount of!), organising and cataloguing these
                resources for
                the benefit of the wider design community. The result is a wealth of resources. The <a
                    href="https://designsystemsrepo.com/articles/" target='__blank'>articles</a> that Limcaco has
                curated are particularly worth
                exploring.</p>

            <h3>Learning from the trailblazers…</h3>

            <p>GOV.UK’s <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/design-of-the-year" target='__blank'>award-winning
                    work</a> is celebrated worldwide.
                In 2013, The Design Museum in London selected the GOV.UK website as its <strong>2013 Design of the Year
                    Awards
                    Winner</strong>. The same year GOV.UK won <strong>a prestigious black pencil at the D&amp;AD
                    Awards</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>Black pencils are only awarded for outstanding projects – they aren’t awarded every year – and GOV.UK now
                ranks
                alongside other black pencil winners including the iPhone (2008) and the iconic ‘Cadburry’s Gorilla’
                advertisement
                (2010).</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk" target='__blank'>GOV.UK Design System</a> is a
                fantastic resource and, to the
                GOV.UK team’s remarkable credit, they have paved the way in opening up their processes and sharing the
                lessons they
                have learned.</p>


            <figure>
                <img src="/images/ch2/gov-uk.png" alt="Placeholder">
                <figcaption>The GOV.UK Design System, published in the open, is home to a wealth of information.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Public sector organisations are <strong>often rightly criticised for moving slowly thanks to their often
                    bottomless
                    wells of bureaucracy</strong>. GOV.UK is the opposite, it moves quickly and is constantly exploring
                new ways to
                optimise its processes.</p>
            <p>It’s a rare example of a public sector organisation teaching the private sector best practice. As the
                team put it:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>The GOV.UK Design System is for everyone, with a strong community sitting behind it. It brings
                    together the
                    latest research, design and development from across government to make sure it’s representative and
                    relevant for
                    its users.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>GOV.UK offers ample lessons on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/" target='__blank'>Styles:</a></strong> Guides
                    for applying
                    layout, typography, colour and more;</li>
                <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/" target='__blank'>Components:</a></strong>
                    A library of
                    reusable, accessible components for buttons, checkboxes, tags and more; and</li>
                <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/" target='__blank'>Patterns:</a></strong>
                    Best practice design
                    solutions for specific user-focused tasks, all supported by written guidance.</li>
            </ul>


            <p>Finally, GOV.UK has a thriving <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/"
                    target='__blank'>community</a> sharing best
                practice and <strong>encouraging designers from the wider (non-governmental) community to get involved
                    proposing and
                    developing new components and patterns</strong>.</p>
            <p>If you haven’t explored GOV.UK’s Design System, I strongly suggest you take a look. The level of detail
                the GOV.UK
                team focus on – in the design system’s <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/"
                    target='__blank'>button
                    documentation</a>, for example – is, and I don’t think I’m guilty of hyperbole: breathtaking.</p>
            <p>It’s refreshing (and very unusual) to see a government sector team moving faster than its private sector
                counterparts. Not only that, but the GOV.UK team is opening up as much of their work as possible. The <a
                    href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles" target='__blank'>government design
                    principles</a> are rich with
                valuable advice and can offer the private sector – indeed, any organisation – lessons from which to
                learn.</p>
            <p>If you’d like to get an idea of how far ahead the GOV.UK team are planning, they’ve even published their
                <a href="https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/5?fullscreen=true" target='__blank'>Design System
                    Roadmap Board</a> and <a href="https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/4" target='__blank'>Design

            <p>All being well, this chapter has introduced you to the core principals of <strong>how to build
                    consistently designed
                    user interface elements</strong> that will act as the foundation of your UI.</p>
            <p>In the next chapter – <a href="/chapters/03-Information-Architecture.html">Chapter
                    3: Information Architecture</a> – I’ll introduce the idea of using these elements as the basis for
                constructing
                components and pages, so that you can further develop your understanding of user interface design. 🎉
            </p>

            <h3>Further Reading</h3>
            <p>There are many great publications, offline and online, that will help further underpin your understanding
                of user interface design. I’ve included a few below to start you on your journey.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Christian Leborg’s <a href="https://amzn.to/31EaRoa" target='__blank'>Visual Grammar</a> helps to
                    explain the fundamental
                    principles of visual grammar, the core graphic building blocks from which we build elements. It’s an
                    excellent book that focuses on the foundations – point, line and plane – from which all interfaces
                    are
                    built.</li>
                <li>Manuela Langella’s <a
                        href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/user-interfaces-icons-visual-elements-screen-design/"
                        target='__blank'>Designing
                        For User Interfaces: Icons As Visual Elements For Screen Design</a> – sponsored by Adobe and
                    published
                    by the fine folks at Smashing Magazine – complements this chapter perfectly. Langella provides a
                    thoroughly
                    in-depth view of the role that icons can play as a part of user interfaces.</li>
                <li>Lastly, I’d strongly recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/2Fdftbn" target='__blank'>Universal
                        Principles of Design</a>. It
                    covers ‘125 Ways to Enhance Usability, Influence Perception, Increase Appeal, Make Better Design
                    Decisions,
                    and Teach through Design’ and I’ve used it as a backbone for my teaching since it was published.
