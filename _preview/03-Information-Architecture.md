<p>In this chapter <strong>I’ll level up the complexity a little</strong>. I’ll take the idea of components that I explored in Chapter 2 and develop it to explore the creation of <strong>patterns, reusable solutions to user interface problems that occur frequently</strong>.</p>

<p>Once I’ve explored patterns, <strong>I’ll tie everything together</strong> to consider how <strong>we can use patterns, alongside components and objects, to build pages</strong>. With patterns and pages covered, I’ll stress the need to consider information architecture, <strong>so that we ensure our users can find their way to what they’re looking for</strong>.</p>

<p>Lastly, I’ll introduce a number of methods – iconic layouts, blockframes and wireframes – at different levels of fidelity, which are <strong>useful  at different stages of the design process</strong> and which will pave the way for Chapter 4, <strong>where I explore user flows and getting from A → B</strong>.</p>"

Overview
--------

When we design an interface, it’s important to put some thought into our overall information architecture (IA). Information architecture is focused on **organising, structuring and labelling content in a way that eases users through the overall information presented**.

Our goal as designers is to:

1. **help users find the information they’re looking for**; and

2. **enable them to complete the goals they aim to undertake**.

In order to do this, it’s important to put some thought into **how the different elements we use in an interface fit together as part of the overall system** within which they exist.

To design an effective information architecture, **we need to consider the relationship of elements at a range of different levels**:

+ The Pattern Level
+ The Page Level; and
+ The Site Level *

The components and patterns we design – the content elements that make up our pages – **will have their own information architecture that we need to consider at the micro-level**.

Similarly, pages will have a page-level information architecture, that relates to the context in which they’re consumed, for example, in a browser in a desktop or a mobile context. **How pages are laid out, with a considered hierarchy, will help users achieve their goals.**

At the macro-level, we need to **consider the overall information architecture of the site or application we’re building**. We need to **ensure that we organise our information clearly**, ensuring users understand the overall structure of the site and enabling them to build a ‘mental model’ of how everything is organised.

With the overview covered, let’s get down to business and explore some further building blocks of user interfaces: patterns.

\* Our site might, of course, be an app.
