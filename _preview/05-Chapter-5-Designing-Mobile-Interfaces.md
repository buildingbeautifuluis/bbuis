### Draft Content

**Pre-Release notes here. Anything I’d like to draw Jordan’s and Kyle’s attention to.** These are the titles I have in my scratch files, but they’re not right:

+ [Mobile First](#)
+ [Size Matters](#)
+ [Reachability](#)
+ [Structured vs. Unstructured Content](#) _/* Alorenz */_
+ [XXXX](#)

What is it specifically about mobile pages that’s different from a UI perspective? There’s less space, images might need to be de-emphaised (like mrmurphy.com) to improve legibility.

The benefits of a mobile-first approach, focus, etc..

Size Matters: Tap targets, etc.. Finger sizes at different ages, etc..

Further Reading
---------------

There are many great publications, offline and online, that will help further underpin your understanding of designing user interfaces for a mobile context. I’ve included a few below to start you on your journey.

+ Luke Wroblewski’s [Mobile First](https://amzn.to/2IK0PcF) – published in 2011 – is rightfully regarded as the book that encouraged designers to adopt a mobile first approach to designing for the web. It might be almost a decade old, but it’s still well worth reading for its focus on the benefits that a mobile first approach offers.

+ Nick Babich’s [A Comprehensive Guide To Mobile App Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/comprehensive-guide-to-mobile-app-design/) – sponsored by Adobe and published by the fine folks at Smashing Magazine – complements this chapter perfectly. Babich provides a thoroughly in-depth view of the challenges faced when designing for a mobile context and I’d strongly recommend reading his article, once you’ve completed this chapter.

+ Lastly, Giles Colborne’s [Simple and Usable Web, Mobile, and Interaction Design](https://amzn.to/2XPSn1P) – though not exclusively about designing mobile interfaces – is an excellent book that explores the user experience benefits of embracing simplicity and focusing on usability. It’s a short, sharp read that’s packed with useful advice.
