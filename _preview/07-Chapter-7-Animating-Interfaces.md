### Animation everywhere…

…the use of **subtle, yet delightful interactions, which provide feedback to the user in a delightful manner**.

As computers have become more powerful and, hand-in-hand with this, our connections to the web have become more accommodating, there has been **a rise in the use of animation within interfaces**.

Users now expect animation to be an integral part of a user interface and, as a consequence, static interfaces have become less appealing. I’ll explore the use of animation in [Chapter 7: Animating Interfaces](#), but as I explore patterns, it’s worth bearing in mind that **patterns exist not just for how elements look, but also how they feel**.

As you explore patterns and build your own library of examples, it’s worth noting how the various patterns you encounter work at an interactive level, considering:

+ how interfaces change as you interact with them;
+ how transitions are used to signal a shift from one state to another; and
+ how long transitions take.
