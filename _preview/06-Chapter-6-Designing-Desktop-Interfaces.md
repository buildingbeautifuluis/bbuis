### Draft Content

**Pre-Release notes here. Anything I’d like to draw Jordan’s and Kyle’s attention to.** These are the titles I have in my scratch files, but they’re not right:

+ [A Hierarchy of Needs](#)
+ [Typography at Macro- and Micro-Level](#)
+ [Composition and Grid Systems](#)
+ [The Importance of Clear Calls to Action](#)
+ [Anatomy of a CTA](#)

The last two are virtually the same, there needs to be some differentiations. What is it specifically about desktop pages that’s difference from a UI perspective? There’s more space, more opportunity for art direction. Everything can breathe a little more.

If we’re mentioning grid systems, mention Khoi Vinh’s book.
