opening-text: "<p class='text--warning'><strong>This is draft content.</strong> I’m working on this chapter as we speak (23 August), I’ll be releasing it section by section over the next few days.</p>

<p>With our pages built, <strong>we need to focus on the flows that users take through the user interfaces we design</strong>. In this chapter, I’ll explore designing user flows, stressing the need to <strong>consider flows in different contexts: page-to-page, and state-to-state</strong>. In short: I’ll explore the idea of getting from A → B, <strong>ensuring our users are guided by our user interface</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ll also consider <strong>a number of critical flows that need to be considered when you’re designing digital products</strong>, including: <strong>’onboarding’</strong>, when a user is taken through the initial screens of an application; and considering <strong>’empty states’</strong>, when a user is confronted by an application that, at that moment, contains no content.</p>"

### Draft Content

**Pre-Release notes here. Anything I’d like to draw Jordan’s and Kyle’s attention to.**

The above section titles are loose. I’m not 100% about them and they may need top be re-ordered. We do, however, need to consider empty states and onboarding somewhere so explore.

Further Reading
---------------

There are many great publications, offline and online, that will help further underpin your understanding of user journeys. I’ve included a few below to start you on your journey.

+ Alexander Handley’s [User Flow Is the New Wireframe](https://uxdesign.cc/when-to-use-user-flows-guide-8b26ca9aa36a) – for UX Collective – is well worth reading. Its emphasis on the different resolution of design deliverables (created at low-, mid- and high-fidelity) is well worth noting.

+ Donna Lichaw and Eva-Lotta Lamm’s [The User’s Journey: Storymapping Products That People Love](https://amzn.to/2WFmIig) is an excellent guide to user journeys, positioning users – as the heroes – at the heart of your product’s story.

+ Lastly – although its printing and production values leave a lot to be desired – Peter W. Szabo’s [User Experience Mapping](https://amzn.to/2FdVlWz) is a very comprehensive overview of user story maps and customer journey maps.
