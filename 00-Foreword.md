Foreword
========

<!-- 190 Words -->

Given the substantial amount of work that has gone into writing and editing this book, I think it would be a nice touch to find someone to write a foreword.

A foreword’s always helpful, not least because it provides a seal of approval from someone respected in the industry. (This is always useful for marketing, too.)

I have asked Alla Kholmatova and she has agreed to write the foreword for us, which I am delighted about.

Alla is currently Director at [CraftUI](http://craftui.com). She previously worked as Head of Design at [Bulb](https://bulb.co.uk), after working as a Senior Product Designer at [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com) (where she worked heavily on evolving FutureLearn’s design system).

Alla is an incredibly talented designer and she’s written a fantastic book on [Design Systems](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/design-systems-book/), for Smashing Magazine, which fits well with this book’s focus.
