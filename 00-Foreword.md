Foreword
========

<!-- 190 Words -->

Given the substantial amount of work that has gone into writing and editing this book, I think it would be a nice touch to find someone to write a foreword.

A foreword’s always helpful, not least because it provides a seal of approval from someone respected in the industry. (This is always helpful for marketing, too.)

I have in mind a few people, but we’ll need to see of they’re acceptable to the Adobe XD team.

Top of my list would be either Alla Kholmatova or Tim Van Damme.

Alla is currently Director at CraftUI. She previously worked as Head of Design at Bulb, after working at FutureLearn (where she worked heavily on evolving FutureLearn’s design system). Alla is an incredibly talented designer and she’s written a book on design systems, which fits well.

Tim is currently Principal Designer at Abstract. He previously worked at Gowalla, Instagram and Dropbox. He’s an incredibly talented designer and I think he’d be ideal.

There may be an issue with Tim’s role at Abstract, however. If so, I have some other suggestions.
